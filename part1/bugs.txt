Bugs Found:
Many unsanitized inputs in which attackers could abuse such as the director variable that is settable via a GET Http request even though the variable is useless and has no sanitization.
Too much trust in the user when dealing with inputting cards via file upload. (Easily manipulated gift card information in the .gftcrd files)
Hardcoded SQL statements without any sanitization as well.
No backup or logs for gift card usage
No validation when users first register with the service, leading to a direct error page if a user already exists and no password restrictions, allowing users to use very weak passwords to log in with. There are also no restrictions on how many times a user can try to log in to an account, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks.
Unencrypted card information in the database
No unique salts for each account leading to multiple similar hashes in the database for similar passwords
Unintuitive UI (it really sucks)
